## We are a pet family

The Cave family loves their pets and our pets know it! No piece of furniture is off limits for a snooze, dinner is always plentiful and (usually) on time, and snuggles are limitless.

## Adopt Don't Shop

Most of the Cave Family pets are rescues, or, as Libby states, "gently used models".  We have never really understood why someone would pay top dollar for a pure bred puppy when a discounted, older mutt from the shelter will suffice. The mutt will also be more grateful for the loving home, and they will also already have basic training. 

## A Dog Family with some exceptions
Cave Family pets are typically lovable dogs, but we have dabbled with other species. Beta fish and hermit crabs have inhabited the Cave home temporarily, but we didn't venture much further than that. Allergies and a traumatic history with our grandparent's demon cat made us hesitant to expand the our pet options to include felines, but Maggie broke the mold when she rescued Meatball from a gutter. While this little black cat fits in well with her brother Arti and cousin Mabel, she is a Cat through and through. Never before had a Cave been bullied so effectively and enjoyably by a 9 pound entity. Despite her feline tendencies, Meatball is still considered a puppy in our eyes.
